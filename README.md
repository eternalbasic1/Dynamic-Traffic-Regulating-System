# Dynamic-Traffic-Regulating-System
Code Developed using Python/OpenCV

In this Repository we Developed Code for 4 Way traffic lane (ie., A Junction). In this we will be using OPENCV built in Module from Python 
The Main idea works by converting the Color imaged video into black&White image(0's &1's)
After Detecting the Vehicle Count we we will be using the file system concept (ie., txt files) and sending those vehicle count into those .txt files  for future uses :)

To Run the above Code you need following :
1) Python _ latest version to be installed
2) Opencv module 
3) Numpy

ðŸ˜‡ Everything set you are ready to get 

Run Vehicle_detection_main.py
